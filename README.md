# issues

The goal of issues is to analyze responses to issues on GitHub repositories.

## Run script

The main analysis script is `04-issues-analyze.R` .
All data necessary to run this script (scraped on 2024-04-07 using up-to-date CRAN packages) is already committed to this repository.
To refresh the data, run the `01-*.R`, `02-*.R` and `03-*.R` scripts in sequence.
